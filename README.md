# Software_Engineering2
This is a repository containing the second assignment of the software engineering course.
This assignment involves creating a simulation of a program to run a mobile phone, and simulating some of the applications that reside inside.
The first application is a modified version of the contact list implemented in the first assignment.
The second application is an SMS messaging service that allows users to communicate.
The next is a calendar that allows users to schedule meetings and appointments.
There is also a media player that should be able to 'play' a variety of media file types.
